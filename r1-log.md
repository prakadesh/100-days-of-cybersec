# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [PRAKADESH]

The log of my #100DaysOfCybersecurity challenge. Started on [April 19, Wednesday, 2023].

## Log

### R1D1 
completed my first day of learning cybersecurity 
by completing the **Introduction to Cybersecurity course** offered by Cisco, where I learned about a variety of topics related to cybersecurity,
- Different types of attacks and attack vectors
- Defense mechanisms such as firewalls, IDS, IPS, and DPS
- Security models like Bell-LaPadula, Biba, and Clark-Wilson
- Basic security controls like authentication, authorization, and encryption

The course emphasized the importance of understanding and minimizing attack pathways in order to better protect organizations from cyberattacks. It also stressed the need for strong passwords, software upgrades, and security awareness training for staff members.

Overall, I found the course to be very informative and a great foundation for further learning in the cybersecurity field.

### R1D2
completed my day 2 on  **The frameworks and standards** where i learned on:

- The NIST Cybersecurity Framework provides a flexible, risk-based approach to cybersecurity that can be customized to an organization's specific needs.

- ISO/IEC 27001 is an international standard that provides a comprehensive framework for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS).

- CIS Controls is a set of 20 critical security controls that organizations can use to protect their systems and networks against cyber attacks.

- PCI DSS is a set of requirements that organizations must follow if they handle credit card data.

- HIPAA Security Rule provides guidelines for protecting the privacy and security of protected health information (PHI) in the healthcare industry.

- COBIT is a framework for governance and management of IT that provides a holistic approach to IT security.

- ITIL is a set of best practices for IT service management that includes a security management process.

- CSA Security Guidance provides best practices for securing cloud computing environments.

- OWASP provides a set of guidelines for developing secure web applications.

- SANS Critical Security Controls is a set of 20 controls that organizations can implement to improve their cybersecurity posture.

### R1D3
completed my day 3 on  **cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities**

learned on **Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools & Cyber Attacks** by IBM on coursera

### R1D4
completed my day 4 on Symmetric encryption learned that 

- It is one of the fundamental building blocks of cryptography that provides confidentiality, while data integrity and authenticated encryption provide both confidentiality and data integrity.

- Symmetric encryption is a technique in which the same key is used for encrypting and decrypting data. The security of symmetric encryption relies on keeping the key secret. However, this technique does not provide any assurance about the integrity of the data.

- Data integrity is the assurance that data has not been tampered with during transit. To ensure data integrity, authenticated encryption is used, which provides both confidentiality and data integrity. Authenticated encryption uses a symmetric encryption algorithm and a message authentication code (MAC) algorithm. The MAC algorithm produces a tag that is attached to the encrypted data to ensure data integrity.

- There are different symmetric encryption algorithms such as AES, DES, and Blowfish, while there are different authenticated encryption algorithms such as AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, and AES-CCM. Both symmetric encryption and authenticated encryption are essential to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data in various applications such as communication, storage, and e-commerce.
