## Log

### R1D1 
completed my first day of learning cybersecurity 
by completing the Introduction to Cybersecurity course offered by Cisco, where I learned about a variety of topics related to cybersecurity,
- Different types of attacks and attack vectors
- Defense mechanisms such as firewalls, IDS, IPS, and DPS
- Security models like Bell-LaPadula, Biba, and Clark-Wilson
- Basic security controls like authentication, authorization, and encryption

The course emphasized the importance of understanding and minimizing attack pathways in order to better protect organizations from cyberattacks. It also stressed the need for strong passwords, software upgrades, and security awareness training for staff members.

Overall, I found the course to be very informative and a great foundation for further learning in the cybersecurity field.
